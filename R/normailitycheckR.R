#I would like this function to be an entire suite of normality tests and plots like the Q-Q plot. the function will keep going through each one until it either finsihes or detects nonnormal data. IF it finishes I want the function to print/save a full report of the tests and if it finds non normal data I want it to switch to a non normal set of tests.
